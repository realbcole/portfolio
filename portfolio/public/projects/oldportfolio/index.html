                    My name is Brandon Cole and I'm a game design and development major at RIT.

                    I have experience with many different programming languages and tools, and I'm always looking to learn more. 
                    I can see myself successful in any role where I can contribute with my creativity and problem solving skills.

            <h1>Audio Visualizer</h1>
            <p>BCOLE'S Audio Visualizer was originally a homework assignment for my class Rich Media and Web
                Applications I. It has been greatly improved upon since. The audio visualizer utilizes the Web Audio API
                as well as the Canvas API to retrieve audio data from an MP3 file and draw meaningful visualizations of
                it on the screen. It is also very aesthetically pleasing and I'm extremely happy with how it turned out.

            <h1>Meal Finder</h1>
            <p>Meal Finder is a web service application I developed for my Intro to Game Web Tech class. It utilizes a
                web API called TheMealDB to find meals based on an ingredient that the user
                searches. When an ingredient is searched, it returns an image of the meal, and you may click the image
                to go to the website where the data came from. If
                'Include Ingredients' and/or 'Include Recipe' is selected, it will also return an ingredient list along
                with measurements, and a recipe.

                New York State Park Buddy is a webpage used for getting information on New York State Parks. Developed using
                Mapbox and the Bulma CSS Framework, the webpage allows users to click on markers on the map to show more 
                information about that park. There is also a favorites section that the user can add and remove parks from.

            <h1>Truth</h1>
            <p>Truth is a game I made along with a team of four for the 2022 Brackey's game jam. My contributions to the
                project include
                all of the programming, the main menu, and some level design. The theme for the game jam was "It is
                not real." With this theme I thought of the concept of a platformer where there are platforms you see
                that are not real
                and there are platforms that you can't see that are real. You play as a red headed man who collects
                mushrooms that
                allow him to see the truth and rocks to slingshot at the mushroom enemies. There are also wall mushrooms
                that shoot projectiles at the player.</p>

            <h1>Survive</h1>
            <p>Survive is the first game I made. You play as a little survivor who has to pick up weapons, shields, and
                allies in order
                to fight off the relentless skeletons. The game is based on waves, where more skeletons spawn each wave.
                There is also a
                weapon upgrade that has a small chance of spawning each wave.
