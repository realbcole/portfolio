Audio Effects
    - Added treble, bass, and distortion nodes
    - At first the visualizer did not reflect the changes, but fixed by changing order of nodes

Sprite
    - Fish class
    - Draws a fish at a specific location
    - y value is based on audio data, so fish move up and down to the music
    - The fish also start behind the waves to add a cool effect

App data
    - JSON file contains:
        - Title
        - Audio file names
        - Image file names

Aesthetics
    - Grade (0-15%) = 15%
    - I love the aesthetics of my visualizer, I think it looks really nice
    - The gradient makes the image look way nicer
    - Noise looks good ontop of the gradient and image
    - Fish come out of the water
    - Bars are on the sun
    - Invert colors looks really cool, and I made the rest of the elements on the page match
